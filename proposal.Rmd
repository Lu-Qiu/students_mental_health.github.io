### Project title

Students Mental Health

### Motivation 



### Intended final products


### Data sources

* We plan to use the Kaggle open data set [Students Mental Health Assessments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonia22222/students-mental-health-assessments/data) which provides results of an anonymous survey with over 7000 college students' reponses. 

* It records each student's basic info (age, gender, department), CGPA, mental health related scores (`Stress_Level`, `Depression_Score`, `Depression_Score`), and other factors that may be associated with their mental health (e.g. sleep quality, physical activity, family history of mental health issues).

### Planned Analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

Challenges:

* Addressing Missing Data:
Within our extensive dataset, a substantial number of variables exhibit missing values.
* Enhancing Variable Selection:
As we strive to comprehensively examine aspects of stress level, depression score, anxiety score, and beyond, it is essential to broaden the spectrum of variables in our dataset
* Data Quality Issues:
We need to ensure the quality of the data is crucial. Data may contain errors, outliers, or inconsistencies that can lead to biased or inaccurate results. 
* Elevating Website Design:
Our vision for the future involves the creation of a state-of-the-art website with advanced features and a visually appealing design.
