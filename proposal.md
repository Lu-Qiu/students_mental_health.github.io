### Tentative Project title

Students Mental Health: Exploring Factors Associated with Students’
Mental Well-being

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project comes from the high prevalence of
mental health problems among students. According to the American College
Health Association, in 2022, over three-quarters of college students
(77%) experienced moderate to serious psychological distress. 35% of
students were diagnosed with anxiety, while 27% had depression. Mental
health problems can have a profound and wide-ranging impact on students,
affecting their overall well-being, academic performance, and daily
life. Our goal is to uncover and highlight patterns in student mental
well-being, encouraging greater awareness and prompting discussions
backed by data.

### Intended final products

- A website with homepage for overview of our project, a page for
  exploratory analyses, a page for statistical analyses, a page for
  interactive dashboard by R-Shiny, and a page for project report.
- A detailed project report.
- A two-minute narrated screencast illustrating our project.

### Data sources

- We plan to use the Kaggle open data set [Students Mental Health
  Assessments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonia22222/students-mental-health-assessments/data)
  which provides results of an anonymous survey with over 7000 college
  students’ reponses.

- It records each student’s basic info (age, gender, department), CGPA,
  mental health related scores (`Stress_Level`, `Depression_Score`,
  `Depression_Score`), and other factors that may be associated with
  their mental health (e.g. sleep quality, physical activity, family
  history of mental health issues).

### Planned Analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**Challenges:**

- Addressing Missing Data: Within our extensive dataset, a substantial
  number of variables exhibit missing values.
- Enhancing Variable Selection: As we strive to comprehensively examine
  aspects of stress level, depression score, anxiety score, and beyond,
  it is essential to broaden the spectrum of variables in our dataset.
- Data Quality Issues: We need to ensure the quality of the data is
  crucial. Data may contain errors, outliers, or inconsistencies that
  can lead to biased or inaccurate results.
- Website Design: We plan to create a state-of-the-art website with
  advanced features and a visually appealing design.
- R-Shiny Interactive Dashboard: We plan to use R-Shiny to build an
  interactive platform.
