Challenges:

- Addressing Missing Data: Within our extensive dataset, a substantial
  number of variables exhibit missing values.
- Enhancing Variable Selection: As we strive to comprehensively examine
  aspects of stress level, depression score, anxiety score, and beyond,
  it is essential to broaden the spectrum of variables in our dataset
- Data Quality Issues: We need to ensure the quality of the data is
  crucial. Data may contain errors, outliers, or inconsistencies that
  can lead to biased or inaccurate results.
- Elevating Website Design: Our vision for the future involves the
  creation of a state-of-the-art website with advanced features and a
  visually appealing design.
